# deadlock-detection-system
Overview
The Deadlock Detection System is a tool designed to simulate and detect potential deadlocks in a system, specifically using a bank account transfer simulation. The system analyzes resource allocation and determines if there are any circular dependencies that could lead to a deadlock scenario.

Features
Simulates bank account transfers.
Identifies potential deadlocks in the system.
Provides a visual and/or textual representation of the deadlock scenario.
How It Works
The system simulates bank transactions between multiple accounts. As resources (in this case, money) are transferred between accounts, the system tracks the allocation and wait states of resources. It then applies the Banker's Algorithm to detect deadlocks.

Example
Imagine multiple accounts transferring funds between each other. If account A is waiting for account B, account B is waiting for account C, and account C is waiting for account A, the system detects this cycle as a potential deadlock.
